# Documentation Updates

## Purpose

This file tracks documentation tasks that need to be completed. Tasks are automatically added by the `/fix` command when code fixes are implemented that should be reflected in the knowledge base.

## How It Works

1. **During Development**: Use `/fix <description>` to implement code fixes
2. **Automatic Logging**: Each fix adds a task here with context
3. **Periodic Review**: Review and batch similar documentation updates
4. **Update Docs**: Complete the documentation changes
5. **Check Off**: Mark tasks as complete with `[x]`

## Task Format

Each task includes:
- **Description**: What needs to be documented
- **Fixed**: What was changed in the code
- **Suggested location**: Where the docs should be updated (if known)
- **Context**: Why this matters or what pattern to document
- **Date**: When the fix was made
