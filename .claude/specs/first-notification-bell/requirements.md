# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature introduces a notification system to the application's top bar. Users will be able to view and track incoming messages through a bell icon that displays unread counts and provides quick access to a message list. The notification bell will serve as a central hub for message alerts, helping users stay informed about new communications without navigating away from their current context.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Notification Bell Display

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a bell icon in the top bar, so that I can quickly identify where to access my notifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a bell icon in the top bar
2. WHEN the user views the top bar THEN the bell icon SHALL be clearly visible and recognizable as a notification indicator
3. WHEN the user hovers over the bell icon THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback (e.g., color change or tooltip)

### Requirement 2: Unread Message Badge

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a red badge with the number of unread messages on the bell icon, so that I know when I have new notifications without opening the menu.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN there are unread messages THEN the system SHALL display a red badge on the bell icon
2. WHEN the badge is displayed THEN the system SHALL show the count of unread messages
3. WHEN there are no unread messages THEN the system SHALL NOT display the badge
4. WHEN the unread count exceeds 99 THEN the system SHALL display "99+" in the badge
5. WHEN new messages arrive THEN the system SHALL update the badge count immediately

### Requirement 3: Notification List Display

**User Story:** As a user, I want to click the bell icon to see a list of my messages, so that I can review recent communications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the bell icon THEN the system SHALL display a dropdown/panel with the message list
2. WHEN the notification panel is open AND the user clicks outside the panel THEN the system SHALL close the panel
3. WHEN the notification panel is open AND the user clicks the bell icon again THEN the system SHALL close the panel
4. WHEN there are no messages THEN the system SHALL display an empty state message (e.g., "No notifications")
5. WHEN the message list is displayed THEN the system SHALL show messages in reverse chronological order (newest first)

### Requirement 4: Message Item Content

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see key information about each message including who sent it, a preview of the content, and when it was sent, so that I can quickly assess the importance and context of each notification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying a message item THEN the system SHALL show the sender's name
2. WHEN displaying a message item THEN the system SHALL show a description of up to 150 characters
3. WHEN the message description exceeds 150 characters THEN the system SHALL truncate the text and append an ellipsis ("...")
4. WHEN displaying a message item THEN the system SHALL show the time the message was sent
5. WHEN the message was sent today THEN the system SHALL display the time in relative format (e.g., "5 minutes ago", "2 hours ago")
6. WHEN the message was sent on a previous day THEN the system SHALL display the date (e.g., "Yesterday", "Jan 15")

### Requirement 5: Message Read Status

**User Story:** As a user, I want to visually distinguish between read and unread messages, so that I can focus on new notifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a message is unread THEN the system SHALL display it with a visual indicator (e.g., bold text, background color, or dot)
2. WHEN a user clicks on a message item THEN the system SHALL mark that message as read
3. WHEN a message is marked as read THEN the system SHALL update the unread badge count
4. WHEN all messages are marked as read THEN the system SHALL remove the badge from the bell icon

### Requirement 6: Message Interaction

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with messages in the notification list, so that I can navigate to related content or take action on the notification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a message item THEN the system SHALL navigate to the associated content or detail view
2. WHEN a user hovers over a message item THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback (e.g., background color change)
3. WHEN a message item is clickable THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate cursor (e.g., pointer)

### Requirement 7: Notification Performance

**User Story:** As a user, I want the notification system to be responsive and performant, so that it doesn't slow down my experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new messages arrive THEN the system SHALL update the notification badge within 2 seconds
2. WHEN the user clicks the bell icon THEN the system SHALL open the notification panel within 500 milliseconds
3. WHEN displaying the message list THEN the system SHALL render all visible messages within 1 second
4. IF the message list contains more than 50 messages THEN the system SHALL implement pagination or virtual scrolling

### Requirement 8: Accessibility

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the notification system to be fully accessible, so that I can use it effectively with assistive technologies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN the system SHALL allow users to open/close the notification panel using the Enter or Space key
2. WHEN the notification panel is open THEN the system SHALL trap focus within the panel
3. WHEN using a screen reader THEN the system SHALL announce the unread count on the bell icon
4. WHEN using a screen reader THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate labels for all interactive elements
5. WHEN the badge count updates THEN the system SHALL announce the change to screen reader users (using ARIA live regions)
